## Overview

The city of Los Angeles is encouraging residents to install private solar panels as part of a local initiative to combat global warming. This project provides a free service where a city-hired specialist evaluates the installation and maintenance costs of solar panels. The initial MVP is a web-based application enabling residents to schedule appointments and allowing city employees to manage and plan these visits effectively. We've created a user-friendly solar panel planning application that simplifies the process of scheduling evaluations. Get ready to combine your problem-solving skills and creativity to build a tool that makes solar panel installation and maintenance planning a breeze!

The application supports two main roles:

Resident: Can request an appointment for a solar panel evaluation by submitting their contact details, address, and preferred timeslot.

City Hall Employee: Can access appointment requests, generate visit schedules for specialists, and export planning details in a downloadable/printable format.
